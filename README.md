### Hi there 👋
I'm a Full-Stack Developer in progress, currently learning PHP Laravel & Vue.js to build powerful, dynamic web applications.

💡 While I'm diving deep into full-stack development, I also have extensive experience in frontend website customization, graphic design, video editing, and WordPress development. My creative background helps me craft visually stunning and highly functional web experiences.

🌱 Currently Learning: Vue.js, RESTful APIs, and modern web development best practices. I already have experience in Laravel.

🚀 Excited to sharpen my skills, contribute to projects, and collaborate with like-minded developers!
